# OBD1 Data Reader for 1994 Honda Del Sol (Python)

This repository contains a proof-of-concept Python script designed to read OBD1 data from a 1994 Honda Del Sol using a Raspberry Pi. This script is not in a production state and should be used with caution.

## Description

The script reads input from a specified GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi, counts the number of blinks, and matches the count to a corresponding OBD1 code from a JSON file. The JSON file contains diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) specific to the 1994 Honda Del Sol.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi
- GPIO setup for reading OBD1 data
- 1994 Honda Del Sol with a B16A3 Engine
- **Voltage regulator** to step down 12V to 3.3V

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- RPi.GPIO library
- JSON file with OBD1 codes

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obd1-reader.git
    cd obd1-reader
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install RPi.GPIO
    ```

3. Ensure the `honda_del_sol_codes.json` file is in the same directory as the script.

## Voltage Regulation

To protect your Raspberry Pi from the 12V output of the Honda Del Sol, you need to use a voltage regulator to step down the voltage to 3.3V. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Components Needed**: (I'll try and create a schematic soon)
    - Voltage regulator (e.g., LM7805 for 5V output, then a resistor divider or a 3.3V regulator like LD1117-3.3)
    - Resistors (if using a resistor divider)
    - Breadboard and jumper wires

3. **Wiring**:
    - Connect the 12V output from the Honda Del Sol to the input of the voltage regulator.
    - Connect the ground of the voltage regulator to the ground of the Raspberry Pi.
    - Connect the output of the voltage regulator to the GPIO pin (pin 17) on the Raspberry Pi.

4. **Example Circuit**:
    - If using an LM7805:
        - Input: 12V from the car
        - Output: 5V
        - Use a resistor divider to step down from 5V to 3.3V, or use a 3.3V regulator like LD1117-3.3 directly.

## Usage

1. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the OBD1 port of the 1994 Honda Del Sol using the voltage regulator setup.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python obd1_reader.py
    ```

## Code

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
import json

""" This is a proof of concept and definitely not in a 'prod' state. 
Just saving stuff here in case someone finds this and decides to start using it. 
BE CAREFUL!

# GPIO setup
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN)  # Assuming GPIO 18 is connected to the MIL

with open('honda_del_sol_codes.json','r') as f:
    dtc_codes = json.load(f)
    
def read_blinks():
    long_blinks = 0
    short_blinks = 0
    while True:
        if GPIO.input(18) == GPIO.HIGH:
            start_time = time.time()
            while GPIO.input(18) == GPIO.HIGH:
                pass
            blink_duration = time.time() - start_time
            if blink_duration > 1:  # Assuming long blink is > 1 second
                long_blinks += 1
            else:
                short_blinks += 1
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Debounce delay
        if long_blinks > 0 and short_blinks > 0:
            break
    return long_blinks, short_blinks

try:
    while True:
        long_blinks, short_blinks = read_blinks()
        dtc_code = long_blinks * 10 + short_blinks
        dtc_message = dtc_codes.get(str(dtc_code), "Unknown DTC")
        print(f"DTC Code: {dtc_code}, Message: {dtc_message}")
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait before reading the next code
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```
